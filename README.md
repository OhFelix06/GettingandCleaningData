# Getting and Cleaning Data
Coursera Course Project

This repo is for submission of Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

It contains three files. 
* README.md

* CodeBook.md

* run_analysis.R 
  The R script will download the raw data file and unzip it under your working directory at begining.
  It will then read all required tables, combine them into one data set, extract required columns, add more descriptive column names and labels and generate a tidydata set 
  in the end. 
  The package dplyr is required and is loaded at the beginning of the script.
  Other detailed description can be found within the R script file.
